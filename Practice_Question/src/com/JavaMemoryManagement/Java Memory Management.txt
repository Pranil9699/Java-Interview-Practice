Java Memory Management 

The Java Memory Management Actually Having 2 Section or 2 parts ->

1 ) Heap Memory 
       
	Heap Memory Will Having 2 part ->

	
	i) Young Generation
          - In Young Generation Will Start Storing the Object 
          - When The Program Will create anyObject Soo That Will Store
            First Time in Young Generation
          - In Young Gen. Having The Minor Garbag Collector 
          - This Minor Garbag Collector WIll Be Faster Because One Object Will Destory at a Time.
          - Young Generation WIll also Have The 3 part 
               I  ) Young Gen.  
               II ) Survivor Memory 1 (S1)-: 
                    - this Memoery Will Have Small, WHen Young Gen. Memory Will AlThogh Fill then the object will sfited inside S1.
               III) Survivor Memory 2 (s2) -:
                    - When The  s1 will fill than that object will sfited in S2.


      ii) Old Generation
          - When Your Application or website Having The N number Of Object And Then They Need To Delete From heap memory 
          - soo In Old Gen. having The Major Garbag Collector
          - Major Garbag Collector Will destoring the All The Object Which No need Long Soo They Will Destory At One Time And It Take Lot of Time 
          - Because of Lot Of time Some times you Application or your website will show The Time outs Errors

       


   - In heap Memory Having The Memory Pool 
     Memory Pool -:
                  - is used to store immutale objects.
                  - String class, String Pools
                  - Run time By Jvm Memory Managers.



   - In heap memory 
             - In Heap Memory The Stores Objects 
             - JRE Classes will Stores.
             - Garbag Runs On Only Heap Memory To free Some Memory by destroying object which don't have any references.
 
      
  2) Stack Section -
             In The Stack section havig 
             
		i) Permanent Generation -
              	 - In this section will Have MetaData of Classes/Methods.
                   - It's Not Part Of Heap Memory 
                   - This block or Permanent Generation will be Generated At The Run Time


                   IN that Having ,
                    
                   Method Area -
                               - In Method Area Will Have The Class Structure
                               
                                In That Having ,
                                  Run Time Constant Pool-
                                              - Inside Run time Constant Pool Will have The Static Variables And Constants Variable.
           

            ii) Java Stack Memory -
				-It Used To Execute Threads.
				-Method Specifix Values
                        - Local variables like ( int i =0)
                        - Object references which are referring objects on heap memory
                        - Ot Have Refererance Variable which Pointing TO Object 

				- This Will Be Followed LIFO ( Last In First Out) 


				-In That Having ,
						Method Block - 
							- This method Block Be executed When Any Method Will Call 
                                           - One method at One Time Will be Call


Important Point 
Stack Memory Size Is Very less as Compared To Heap Memory.
